# Introduction

Welcome to the Scroll Rollup Node documentation.

## What is Scroll?

Scroll is a zkRollup on Ethereum that enables scaling while maintaining security and decentralization through
zero-knowledge proofs. By moving computation and state storage off-chain while posting transaction data and validity
proofs to Ethereum L1, Scroll achieves higher throughput and lower transaction costs while inheriting Ethereum's
security guarantees.

## What is the Rollup Node?

The rollup node is responsible for constructing the Scroll L2 chain from data posted to Ethereum L1. At its core, the
rollup node implements a derivation function: given the L1 chain state, it deterministically produces the corresponding
L2 chain.

### Core Function

While conceptually the rollup node computes L2 as a pure function of L1 data, in practice it operates
incrementallyâ€”processing new L1 blocks as they arrive and handling reorganizations when the L1 chain restructures. This
incremental approach allows the node to efficiently maintain synchronization without reprocessing the entire chain
history.

The derivation process works by:

1. **Monitoring L1**: Watching for batch commitments, finalization events, and cross-chain messages posted to Ethereum
2. **Decoding Batches**: Extracting and decoding batch data (including blob data) to reconstruct transaction lists
3. **Building Payloads**: Constructing execution payloads with the appropriate transactions and L1 messages
4. **Executing Blocks**: Applying payloads through the execution engine to advance the L2 state

### Architecture

Built on the Reth framework, the rollup node employs an event-driven architecture where specialized components
communicate through async channels:

- **L1 Watcher**: Tracks L1 events and maintains awareness of chain reorganizations
- **Derivation Pipeline**: Transforms batch data from L1 into executable L2 payloads
- **Engine Driver**: Interfaces with the execution engine via the Engine API
- **Chain Orchestrator**: Coordinates the overall flow from L1 events to L2 blocks
- **Network Layer**: Propagates blocks across the P2P network for faster synchronization

### Node Modes

The rollup node can operate in different configurations:

- **Follower Node**: Derives L2 blocks by processing batch data posted to L1, participating in P2P block propagation
- **Sequencer Node**: Actively sequences new transactions into blocks and posts batches to L1
